## Secrets in YAML file

* A single YAML file
* Environment keys at root
* Used by both Chef & applications
* `sync-secrets`
  * Ruby command line tool
  * Relied upon Chef & `scp`
  * Processed in parallel

---

## secrets.yml

```ruby
---
staging:
  project_x:
    admin_email: "do-not-reply@zendesk.com"
  new_relic_api_key: "40d6b575e0fed78ee8483c71b4b2ce0e"

production:
  new_relic_api_key: "4a6e4ec5d55a7c38d8a07e1acc2c52a0"
```

## staging secrets.yml

```ruby
---
project_x:
  admin_email: "do-not-reply@zendesk.com"
new_relic_api_key: "40d6b575e0fed78ee8483c71b4b2ce0e"
```

* Note the root level environment (staging) has been removed
* This allowed code to simply ask for a secret without needing to know the current operating environment

---

## PROS

* Easy to see all secrets <i class="twa twa-smile"></i>
* Single source of truth
* Simple to update, just text!
* Did not rely on an internal / external service
* Access control used Unix permissions
* Managed using Git

* Increasingly slow to push out updates
* Window where some servers could be out-of-sync
* New or previously offline nodes come online and could be out-of-sync
* Difficult to quickly update / revoke a secret
* Not possible for non Ops staff to maintain
